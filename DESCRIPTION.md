# R.E.D App

## Main Idea:
Our team's idea is to bridge the time gap by complementing the myResponder app. Currently, the myResponder app allows CFRs/public to send onsite information to SCDF operators, in which a notification is then pushed out to the CFRs in the vicinity to see if they are available to respond to the incident. However, we feel that we can speed this process up through visual recognition of images, in which notifications to CFRs will then be pushed out at the same time when SCDF operators receive the message. We would like to improve further by notifying non-CFRs of the danger in the vicinity, in which they will be asked to evacuate the area. By doing this, we hope to achieve a lower casualty count as people in the vicinity would be given more time to evacuate the area. 

## Machine Learning using IBM service:
We tapped on IBM's machine learning service, which allowed us to train a Visual Recognition Tool, by feeding different types of images (We experimented on fires, namely,  Car accident fire, Infrastructure fire or Forest fire). After feeding in the images, our model is now ready to predict the next input of image, which will be sent in by a member of public, through the myResponder app. Once the photo is uploaded, it will be predicted using our Visual Recognition tool, allowing a classification of the image (a type of fire in our prototype). SCDF operators will then be clear of the situation at hand, where CFRs and Non-CFRs will also be notified simultaneously, bridging the time lag where SCDF operators do not need to manually assess and push out notifications.

## Why did we do this?
As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. We believe that the extra time saved are the precious few seconds that could prevent much of a disaster's damage. With this, SCDF will be able to optimise their response efforts, which includes saving of lives, allocation of necessary equipment and many other important factors. The snowball effect of the few seconds saved is substantial, allowing for reduced casualties. 

With this, we aim to include non-CFRs in our community, on board the myResponder app. With more people in the community which are able to utilise the app, we can also reduce the burden on emergency hotline, as well as increasing the efficiency of reporting incidents. 


## Publicity Initiative:
For our new function, we are aiming to tap on a new acronym which can be pushed to members of public, in hopes that it will be easier for them to remember. Our new initiative will be
called R.E.D. Reporting, Evacuate, Disseminate. Report the incident, Evacuate the area, Disseminate information to those around you, so as to minimise collateral damage or casualties.
